# About this Dockerfile
#
# This Dockerfile is optimized for local development or deployments which
# require the configuration file to be baked into the resulting image.
#
# If you would rather pass configuration in via other means, such as a
# ConfigMap or environment variable, use the "triageparty/triage-party"
# image published on Docker Hub, or build the equivalent
# using "base.Dockerfile"

# Stage 1: Build Triage Party (identical to base.Dockerfile)
